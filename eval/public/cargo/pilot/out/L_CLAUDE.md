## claude-mem-lite — persistent memory

PreToolUse hooks already run `mem_recall` for past lessons before Read/Edit/Write. The calls worth making proactively:

| When | Call |
|------|------|
| Before Edit/Write | hook already recalled; if an injected `#NN` lesson changed what you did, name `#NN` once where you say so (citing = adopting; uncited lessons decay; skip ones that did not apply) |
| After fixing a non-trivial bug | `mem_save(type="bugfix", lesson_learned="<root cause + fix>", importance=2)` |
| After a non-obvious architecture decision | `mem_save(type="decision", lesson_learned="<constraint + tradeoff>")` |
| Deferring to a future session | `mem_defer({title, priority:1|2|3, detail})`; when fixed, add `closes_deferred=[N]` to `mem_save` |
| Looking up past work / history | `mem_search "keywords"` · `mem_recent` · `mem_timeline` |

Path cost is round-trips, not milliseconds: the PreToolUse hook above already recalls (0 calls) — prefer it. For an explicit query, if these `mem_*` tools are deferred behind ToolSearch this session, the Bash CLI `claude-mem-lite` is one call vs two (ToolSearch + call); the MCP server instructions carry the absolute path to use when it is not on PATH.
